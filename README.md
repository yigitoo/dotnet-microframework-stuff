Netduino by Wilderness Labs-
* Netduino is an open-source electronics platform using the Micro Framework. Originally created by Secret Labs, but now[when?] manufactured and maintained by Wilderness Labs Inc.[22] Based on 168Mhz Cortex-M4 (STM32F4) with up to 1,408 KB of code storage and 164 KB of RAM. On-board USB, Ethernet, Wifi, SD card slot. Development environment is MS Visual Studio and C#. Pin compatible with Arduino shields although drivers are required for some shields.

GHI Electronics

GHI Electronics makes several modules that support the Micro Framework: 
 * EMX Module
 * ChipworkX Module
 * USBizi144 Chipset[25] and USBizi100, whose only difference is the lack of USB host support in the USBizi100[26]

GHI Electronics also makes the .NET FEZ line of very small open-source hardware boards with proprietary firmware, targeted for beginners. They are based on the USBizi chipset and all its features. The FEZ Domino board offers USB host. Even though FEZ is for beginners, it's also a low-cost starting point for professionals wanting to explore NETMF.[27] Some of these boards are physically compatible with the Arduino.

Mountaineer boards
* Mountaineer boards, part of the Mountaineer Group, make a small range of open-source open-hardware boards that make use of the Micro Framework. Mountaineer have ported the Micro Framework for use on the STM32 family of microcontrollers featured on their Mountaineer boards and elsewhere.[28]

STMicroelectronics
* STMicroelectronics, creators of the microcontroller family STM32, make low-cost discovery boards to showcase the controllers, and provides ports of the Micro Framework to run on them.[29]

Micromint
* The Micromint Bambino 200 is the first multi-core processor SBC compatible with the .NET Gadgeteer framework.[31] The model 200 is powered by an NXP LPC4330, the first dual-core ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. Its Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M0 cores are both capable of 204 MHz. It has 264 KB SRAM onboard and 4 MB of flash. The model 200E has all the same features as the model 200, and increased flash memory to 8 MB, 10 Gadgeteer sockets, an Ethernet port, microSD socket, and other features.

.NET Gadgeteer devices
* Several manufacturers make boards and modules compatible with the .NET Gadgeteer rapid-prototyping standard for the framework.

MikroBus.Net
*The MikroBus.Net Quail is an STM32-powered development solution for building hardware prototypes with click boards and C# managed code. It brings together Mikroelectronika click boards and the Micro Framework for embedded devices (NETMF).
